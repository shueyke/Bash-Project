# Bash-Project

About the script:
The script is designed to allow users to manage file permissions and change owners if desired. It uses bash so to run it would require a linux machine or a terminal designed to run bash commands.

What You Will Need:
You should not need anything besides the script and an environment to run bash commands such as visual studio code which you should be able to aquire from https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/?dv=win64user. You will also need to download git to your system to be able to use bash commands which can be downloaded from https://git-scm.com/downloads/win

How It Works:
The script requires the options -o or -p; it could be either or both. The -o option will allow the user to manage onwership of a file or directory and the -p option will allow the user to manage the file permissions. The usuage would look like ./perm_manager [options] -f <filename>
